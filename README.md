# NTD DHIS2 Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks for managing the DHIS2 NTD Database.

## What are Jupyter Notebooks
Notebook documents are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis. Notebooks are perfect to use on NTD DHIS2 database because they can interact with the DHIS2 Web API to perform a wide variety of data management tasks all in a human readable format and within a web browser.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks
To run a Jupyter Notebook, Python must be installed locally. If Python is not already installed for you, we recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a popular distribution. Once Python is installed, Jupyter Lab, the Python application to run Jupyter Notebooks can then be installed. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
